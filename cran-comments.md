This R package was previously on CRAN but was removed late 2019 because it was failing tests. I didn't receive emails because the maintainer address was the one I had at a previous company (AstraZeneca). I've made the required modifications to fix these test failures.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10, R 4.0.2
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (devel 2020-07-19 r78884 and release 4.0.2)

## R CMD check results
Note about possible misspelling of Hsu, et, and al, in DESCRIPTION, but these are correct.
